# Metronome-App


#Goal
When a musician practices their instrument, they often play along a metronome, a timekeeping device that maintains a steady beat. 
On most physical metronomes and metronome apps, the player needs to turn a dial to increase the beats per minute or tap a button repeatedly to set a new tempo. 
Our application will eliminate the need to physically interact with the device while practicing. Instead, players can play a note, clap their hands or 
make any other noise and our software will calculate the new tempo. In addition to modifying a basic metronome, our app can adjust the speed of midi files 
during live playback for practice and performance purposes.

#Application Scenario
The target audience for our application will be amateur and professional musicians. Among a crowded field of metronome-like applications, ours will 
need to differentiate itself based on its accuracy and ease of use through touchless interactions.
